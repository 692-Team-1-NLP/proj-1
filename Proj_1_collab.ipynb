        "Goal of this project is to analyze the frequencies of occurrence of the protagonists and the perpetrator(s) across the novel - per chapter, and per sentence in a chapter, the mention of the crime, and other circumstances surrounding the antagonists. The ultimate objective is to use basic NLP tools to observe any patterns in plot structures across the works of one or all of the authors.  Specifically, analysis questions below need to be answered. \n",
        "\n",
        "Note: To effectively conduct this analysis, you should find resources, and read the plot summaries of each novel, so you can make your search more effective. If plot summaries are not available, use regex to search for clues, and report how well/how fast that approach worked. \n",

        "The plot summary answers derived from reading the book/ summary are located below each question"
