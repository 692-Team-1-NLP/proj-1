    "# `692 Team 1 Proj-1 : Crime Novel Plot Analysis with Regex - Agatha Christie`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The goal of this project is to conduct a plot and protagonist/antagonist analysis of the famous crime novels. For this project, we will analyze five publicly available crime novels/stories by Agatha Christie at the project Gutenberg http://www.gutenberg.org/. The novels chosen are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The Murder on the Links \n",
    "- The Mysterious Affair at Styles \n",
    "- The Secret Adversary \n",
    "- The Man in the Brown Suit \n",
    "- The Secret of Chimneys \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Feel free to use any background resource for the understanding of the plot, protagonist and antagonist names, and other details. Look for spoilers, details, etc. Our goal is not to predict the crime, but to computationally analyze the structure of the plot."

    "- There are inconsistencies between the novel formats. Some of them start with a prologue and others dont. \n",
    "- There is START OF THE PROJECT present in the beginning of most but not all books, others have 'START OF THIS PROJECT', but   table of contents appear after that.\n",
    "- Some of them have the word table of contents, others say contents\n",
    "- some follow roman numeral in naming chapters, others dont\n",
    "- Some use the word 'chapter' , others just kist chapter titles followed by a number\n",
    "- Novel text files have license and other info at the end\n",
    "\n",
    "These factors above will need to be considered in data cleaning. \n",
    "Listing a few key particulars below: \n",

    "- The Murder on the Links \n",
    "  - This Phrase is present at the beginning - \\*** START OF THIS PROJECT \n",

    "  - Each chapter  starts with number followed by title of chapter\n",

    "- The Mysterious Affair at Styles \n",

    "##### Data Tokenization\n",
    "Note: since we are not allowed to use NLTK or Spacy for tokenization, we will have to use python for this as well. \n",
    "We can use split() but that would be very basic as it doesnt achieve tokens in a linguistic sense; we should be able to use the re package that adds support for regex; after all the point for us is to learn regex better. Recommend using re.split with our custom regex \n",

      "found a friend of my childhood in Lieutenant Thomas Beresford (bow,\n",

      "Thomas Beresford. Eleventh and twelfth months: Parlourmaid duties\n",
      "resumed with entire success. At the end of the year left hospital in a\n",
      "blaze of glory. After that, the talented Miss Cowley drove successively\n",

      "land girl, a postwoman, and a bus conductress by way of rounding off\n",
      "my career--but the Armistice intervened! I clung to the office with the\n",

      "and went into hospital out there. Then I got stuck in Egypt till the\n",

      "Tommy flushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, it would have been a bit rough on the mater. As you know, I was\n",

      "bit of spite.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your mother’s dead, isn’t she?” said Tuppence gently.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Rot!” said Tommy hastily. “Well, that’s my position. I’m just about\n",
      "desperate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So am I! I’ve hung out as long as I could. I’ve touted round. I’ve\n",
      "answered advertisements. I’ve tried every mortal blessed thing. I’ve\n",
      "screwed and saved and pinched! But it’s no good. I shall have to go\n",
      "home!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t you want to?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course I don’t want to! What’s the good of being sentimental?\n",
      "Father’s a dear--I’m awfully fond of him--but you’ve no idea how I worry\n",
      "him! He has that delightful early Victorian view that short skirts and\n",
      "smoking are immoral. You can imagine what a thorn in the flesh I am to\n",
      "him! He just heaved a sigh of relief when the war took me off. You see,\n",
      "there are seven of us at home. It’s awful! All housework and mothers’\n",
      "meetings! I have always been the changeling. I don’t want to go back,\n",
      "but--oh, Tommy, what else is there to do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tommy shook his head sadly. There was a silence, and then Tuppence burst\n",
      "out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Money, money, money! I think about money morning, noon and night! I\n",
      "dare say it’s mercenary of me, but there it is!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Same here,” agreed Tommy with feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve thought over every imaginable way of getting it too,” continued\n",
      "Tuppence. “There are only three! To be left it, to marry it, or to make\n",
      "it. First is ruled out. I haven’t got any rich elderly relatives. Any\n",
      "relatives I have are in homes for decayed gentlewomen! I always help old\n",
      "ladies over crossings, and pick up parcels for old gentlemen, in case\n",
      "they should turn out to be eccentric millionaires. But not one of them\n",
      "has ever asked me my name--and quite a lot never said ‘Thank you.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course,” resumed Tuppence, “marriage is my best chance. I made up my\n",

      "I’m not sentimental, you know.” She paused. “Come now, you can’t say I’m\n",
      "sentimental,” she added sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly not,” agreed Tommy hastily. “No one would ever think of\n",
      "sentiment in connection with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s not very polite,” replied Tuppence. “But I dare say you mean it\n",
      "all right. Well, there it is! I’m ready and willing--but I never meet\n",
      "any rich men! All the boys I know are about as hard up as I am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What about the general?” inquired Tommy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I fancy he keeps a bicycle shop in time of peace,” explained Tuppence.\n",
      "“No, there it is! Now _you_ could marry a rich girl.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m like you. I don’t know any.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That doesn’t matter. You can always get to know one. Now, if I see a\n",
      "man in a fur coat come out of the _Ritz_ I can’t rush up to him and say:\n",
      "‘Look here, you’re rich. I’d like to know you.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed female?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t be silly. You tread on her foot, or pick up her handkerchief, or\n",
      "something like that. If she thinks you want to know her she’s flattered,\n",
      "and will manage it for you somehow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You overrate my manly charms,” murmured Tommy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the other hand,” proceeded Tuppence, “my millionaire would probably\n",
      "run for his life! No--marriage is fraught with difficulties. Remains--to\n",
      "_make_ money!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ve tried that, and failed,” Tommy reminded her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ve tried all the orthodox ways, yes. But suppose we try the\n",
      "unorthodox. Tommy, let’s be adventurers!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly,” replied Tommy cheerfully. “How do we begin?”\n",
      "\n",

struck anthony as being possibly of significance'], [7, 73, 'had his search of anthony’s suit-case been merely part of his habitual professional tactics'], [7, 74, 'he might just possibly have had the packet of letters in his hand at the moment when anthony switched on the light, and have shoved it into his pocket mechanically so as to have his hands free'], [7, 78, 'no, anthony felt convinced that giuseppe had been acting as a tool for some outside agency'], [7, 92, 'one of anthony’s first proceedings was to question some of the other waiters who had been friendly with giuseppe, but he obtained very little to go upon'], [7, 95, 'anthony took up the receiver'], [7, 105, '“our worthy publishers,” thought anthony'], [7, 115, '“well,” said anthony, “what about it'], [7, 125, '“dear me,” said

thousand pounds'], [7, 168, 'mr. holmes packed up the manuscript in the small brown bag he carried, wished anthony good morning, and departed'], [7, 170, '“but perhaps he’ll be murdered on the way there,” anthony murmured aloud, as he stared idly out of the window'], [7, 173, 'jimmy, who had been more or less in funds at the time of his encounter with anthony at bulawayo, had advanced him a substantial sum of money which was, as yet, practically untouched'], [7, 174, '“if one’s job’s done with, the other isn’t,” said anthony to himself'], [7, 181, 'with a sigh, anthony produced yet
