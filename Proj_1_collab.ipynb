            "11 he was neat and dandified in appearance\n",
            "12 for neatness of any kind, he had an absolute passion\n",
            "13 to see an ornament set crooked, or a speck of dust, or a slight disarray in one’s attire, was torture to the little man until he could ease his feelings by remedying the matter\n",
            "14 “order” and “method” were his gods\n",
            "15 he had a certain disdain for tangible evidence, such as footprints and cigarette ash, and would maintain that, taken by themselves, they would never enable a detective to solve a problem\n",
            "16 then he would tap his egg-shaped head with absurd complacency, and remark with great satisfaction: “the true work, it is done from  within \n",
            "17 the little grey cells —remember always the little grey cells,  mon ami\n",
            "18 ” i slipped into my seat, and remarked idly, in answer to poirot’s greeting, that an hour’s sea passage from calais to dover could hardly be dignified by the epithet “terrible\n",
            "19 poirot waved his egg-spoon in vigorous refutation of my remark\n",

            "23 “i fancy browning was referring to something more romantic than sea sickness, though\n",
            "24 “because he was an englishman, an islander to whom  la manche  was nothing\n",
            "25 oh, you english\n",

            "37 “fortunately her husband was  homme pratique \n",
            "38 he was also very calm, the crises of the nerves, they affected him not\n",

            "40 naturally when she reached england she was prostrate, but she still breathed\n",

            "42 i composed my face as best i could\n",
            "43 suddenly he stiffened and pointed a dramatic finger at the toast rack\n",
            "44 “ah, par exemple, c’est trop fort!” he cried\n",
            "45 “what is it\n",
            "46 “this piece of toast\n",
            "47 you remark him not\n",

            "58 “it’s cut from a cottage loaf,” i explained soothingly\n",
            "59 poirot threw me a withering glance\n",
            "60 “what an intelligence has my friend hastings!” he exclaimed sarcastically\n",
            "61 “comprehend you not that i have forbidden such a loaf—a loaf haphazard and shapeless, that no baker should permit himself to bake\n",
            "62 i endeavoured to distract his mind\n",
            "63 “anything interesting come by the post\n",
            "64 poirot shook his head with a dissatisfied air\n",
            "65 “i have not yet examined my letters, but nothing of interest arrives nowadays\n",
            "66 the great criminals, the criminals of method, they do not exist\n",
            "67 the cases i have been employed upon lately were  banal  to the last degree\n",
            "68 in verity i am reduced to recovering lost lap-dogs for fashionable ladies\n",
            "69 the last problem that presented any interest was that intricate little affair of the yardly diamond, and that was—how many months ago, my friend\n",

            "75 “a bill\n",
            "76 another bill\n",
            "77 it is that i grow extravagant in my old age\n",

            "104 i shall be obliged if you will drop all cases you have on hand, and devote yourself solely to my interests\n",
            "105 i am prepared to pay any compensation necessary\n",
            "106 i shall probably need your services for a considerable period of time, as it may be necessary for you to go out to santiago, where i spent several years of my life\n",

            "147 certainly it will be pleasant to have  carte blanche  in our investigations; one can be sure that way of wasting no time, but it is something a little bizarre in this problem which arouses my interest\n",
            "148 you remarked the postscript\n",
            "149 how did it strike you\n",
            "150 i considered\n",

            "160 without blotting it, he reread it carefully\n",
            "161 then, not on impulse, but deliberately, he added those last words, and blotted the sheet\n",
            "162 “but why\n",
            "163 “ parbleu\n",
            "164 so that it should produce the effect upon me that it has upon you\n",

            "166 “ mais, oui —to make sure of my coming\n",
            "167 he reread the letter and was dissatisfied\n",
            "168 it was not strong enough\n",
            "169 he paused, and then added softly, his eyes shining with that green light that always betokened inward excitement: “and so,  mon ami , since that postscript was added, not on impulse, but soberly, in cold blood, the urgency is very great, and we must reach him as soon as possible\n",
            "170 “merlinville,” i murmured thoughtfully\n",
            "171 “i’ve heard of it, i think\n",
            "172 poirot nodded\n",
            "173 “it is a quiet little place—but chic\n",
            "174 it lies about midway between bolougne and calais\n",

            "179 also a big place in the country, somewhere in hertfordshire\n",

            "181 i believe he has large south american interests in the city, and has spent most of his life out in chile and the argentino\n",
            "182 “well, we shall hear all details from the man himself\n",
            "183 come, let us pack\n",
            "184 a small suit-case each, and then a taxi to victoria\n",
            "185 “and the countess\n",
            "186 i inquired with a smile\n",

            "188 je m’en fiche\n",

            "192 a woman cannot wait—always remember that, hastings\n",
            "193 eleven o’clock saw our departure from victoria on our way to dover\n",
            "194 before starting poirot had despatched a telegram to mr. renauld giving the time of our arrival at calais\n",
            "195 “i’m surprised you haven’t invested in a few bottles of some sea sick remedy, poirot,” i observed maliciously, as i recalled our conversation at breakfast\n",
            "196 my friend, who was anxiously scanning the weather, turned a reproachful face upon me\n",
            "197 “is it that you have forgotten the method most excellent of laverguier\n",
            "198 his system, i practise it always\n",
            "199 one balances oneself, if you remember, turning the head from left to right, breathing in and out, counting six between each breath\n",
            "200 “h’m,” i demurred\n",
            "201 “you’ll be rather tired of balancing yourself and counting six by the time you get to santiago, or buenos ayres, or wherever it is you land\n",

            "206 i do not run to and fro, making journeys, and agitating myself\n",
            "207 my work is done from within— here \n",
            "208 he tapped his forehead significantly\n",
            "209 as usual, this remark roused my argumentative faculty\n",
            "210 “it’s all very well, poirot, but i think you are falling into the habit of despising certain things too much\n",
            "211 a finger-print has led sometimes to the arrest and conviction of a murderer\n",
            "212 “and has, without doubt, hanged more than one innocent man,” remarked poirot dryly\n",
            "213 “but surely the study of finger-prints and footprints, cigarette ash, different kinds of mud, and other clues that comprise the minute observation of details—all these are of vital importance\n",
            "214 “but certainly\n",
            "215 i have never said otherwise\n",
            "216 the trained observer, the expert, without doubt he is useful\n",
            "217 but the others, the hercules poirots, they are above the experts\n",
            "218 to them the experts bring the facts, their business is the method of the crime, its logical deduction, the proper sequence and order of the facts; above all, the true psychology of the case\n",
            "219 you have hunted the fox, yes\n",
            "220 “i have hunted a bit, now and again,” i said, rather bewildered by this abrupt change of subject\n",
            "221 “why\n",
            "222 “ eh bien , this hunting of the fox, you need the dogs, no\n",
            "223 “hounds,” i corrected gently\n",
            "224 “yes, of course\n",
            "225 “but yet,” poirot wagged his finger at me\n",
            "226 “you did not descend from your horse and run along the ground smelling with your nose and uttering loud ow ows\n",
            "227 in spite of myself i laughed immoderately\n",
            "228 poirot nodded in a satisfied manner\n",
            "229 “so\n",
            "230 you leave the work of the d— hounds to the hounds\n",
            "231 yet you demand that i, hercule poirot, should make myself ridiculous by lying down (possibly on damp grass) to study hypothetical footprints, and should scoop up cigarette ash when i do not know one kind from the other\n",
            "232 remember the plymouth express mystery\n",
            "233 the good japp departed to make a survey of the railway line\n",
            "234 when he returned, i, without having moved from my apartments, was able to tell him exactly what he had found\n",
            "235 “so you are of the opinion that japp wasted his time\n",
            "236 “not at all, since his evidence confirmed my theory\n",
            "237 but  i  should have wasted my time if  i  had gone\n",
            "238 it is the same with so called ‘experts\n",
            "239 remember the handwriting testimony in the cavendish case\n",
            "240 one counsel’s questioning brings out testimony as to the resemblances, the defence brings evidence to show dissimilarity\n",
            "241 all the language is very technical\n",
            "242 and the result\n",
            "243 what we all knew in the first place\n",
            "244 the writing was very like that of john cavendish\n",
            "245 and the psychological mind is faced with the question ‘why\n",
            "246 because it was actually his\n",
            "247 or because some one wished us to think it was his\n",
            "248 i answered that question,  mon ami , and answered it correctly\n",
            "249 and poirot, having effectually silenced, if not convinced me, leaned back with a satisfied air\n",
            "250 on the boat, i knew better than to disturb my friend’s solitude\n",
            "251 the weather was gorgeous, and the sea as smooth as the proverbial mill-pond, so i was hardly surprised to hear that laverguier’s method had once more justified itself when a smiling poirot joined me on disembarking at calais\n",
            "252 a disappointment was in store for us, as no car had been sent to meet us, but poirot put this down to his telegram having been delayed in transit\n",
            "253 “since it is  carte blanche , we will hire a car,” he said cheerfully\n",
            "254 and a few minutes later saw us creaking and jolting along, in the most ramshackle of automobiles that ever plied for hire, in the direction of merlinville\n",
            "255 my spirits were at their highest\n",
