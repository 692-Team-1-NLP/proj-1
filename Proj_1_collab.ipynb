The ultimate objective is to use basic NLP tools to observe any patterns in plot structures across the works of one or all of the authors.  Specifically, analysis questions below need to be answered. \n",

        "#### Data Loading\n",
        "In order to track the exact location of match occurences, we opted to store the corpus as a nested dictionary. The corpus dictionary containts the titles, tokenized contents, and blobbed contents of each book. Internally, the dictionaries are accessied via a numerical index that corresponds to each book, chapter, and sentence. Each book consists of a dictionary of chapter titles and a dictionary of chapter contents. Each chapter consists of a dictionary of sentences. Books, chapters, and sentences are 1-indexed as this allowed for the inclusion of prologue chapters (index=0) that appeared in some of the books. The chapters and sentences were tokenized using regular expressions. Each book followed a unique pattern for the chapter titles as well as the Project Gutenberg prologue and epilogue, so we use the book index to select the appropriate regex for each book. The sentence splitting regex we used accounts for sentences that include punctuation that does not end the sentence. For example, the sentence '\"What?\" he exclaimed' is not split on the question mark. Accounting for the wide variety of unicode quotation marks proved a minor challenge. Special care was also taken not to split on unusual abbreviations like \"Mlle.\" We found it useful to be as explicit as possible when choosing not to split a sentence at an abbreviation as using wildcards introduced to many edge cases. The exception was the pattern \"\\w\\.\\w\\.\" since that general case catches abbreviated names as well as common patterns like \"e.g.\" and \"i.e.\" In general, negative lookahead and lookbehind expressions were critical for maximizing sentence splitting performance. The blobbed contents of each book consits of a single string with all of the words in the book minus chapter titles and punctuation to allow us to extract neighboring words without regard for sentence barriers. \n",
        "#### Data Cleaning\n",
        "During data cleaning, we first identified which types of unique white spaces were included in the text, and opted to remove \"\\r\\n\", hair-spaces and replace them with a single space to make all spaces uniform. One reason to replace rather than remove '\\r\\n' was due to the fact that multi-line sentences in some cases did not use spaces to separate words and just relied on the carriage-return/new-line."

As a result, we included kidnapping, espionage, theft, and conspiracy as potential target crimes.

For this reason, we excluded Mr. Brown from our search to avoid introducing references to a suspect instead of the perpetrator. The bag of words analysis actually was able to identify this issue. \n",

        "This case is a straightforward murder with a single red herring. Mr. Renauld is stabbed to death early in the book and suspicion falls upon his son. However, the real culprit is Mademoiselle Daubreuil. Years before the current murder takes place, Mr. Renauld and Madame Daubreuil, mother of Mademoiselle Daubreuil, had conspired together and killed Madame Daubreuil's husband. When the murder was uncovered, Mr.Renauld disappeared, prompting a long mission of revenge for the mother and daughter. One interesting aspect of this case is the use of the word \"murder.\" Characters throw around many accusaions of murder with brief explanation of how they think the murder occured. This makes the search term more confounding than useful. In order to extract quality details of the murder as opposed to wild accusations, we found it necessary to search for paired terms like \"death..occured,\" examination...body\", and \"body...discovered\" with regex wild cards for any intervening words. \n",

        "\n",
        "This case is another murder. It is complicated by the fact that, in order to prevent a double-jeopardy situation, Poirot argues that one of the two guilty suspects is innocent. Once the trial has moved on, Poirot reveals that the man he had previously argued was innocent is in fact guilty. The reason for this is that the guilty man worked with a partner so that it was physically impossible for him to have committed the whole murder alone. In other words, he is \"innocent\" of half the murder tasks. The guilty pair are Alfred Inglethorp (huspand of the victim) and Evelyn Howard (secretary/assistant of the victim). We found it difficult to catch the moment Poirot reveals the identity of the murderers. Poirot reads a murder-planning letter written to Evelyn Howard, thereby revealing her guilt without actually making any accusation. Likewise, Alfred is exposed when he lunges from hiding. As far as detecting the murderers based on regexes, we had to wait until then next chapter when Poirot launches into an exposition on why he suspected the pair. At this point, the murderers' names occur in sentences that mention their crime."
