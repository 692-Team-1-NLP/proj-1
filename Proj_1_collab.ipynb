            "'\\r\\nI believe that a well-known anecdote exists to the effect that a young\\r\\nwriter, determined to make the commencement of his story forcible and\\r\\noriginal enough to catch and rivet the attention of the most blasé of\\r\\neditors, penned the following sentence:\\r\\n\\r\\n“\\u200a‘Hell!’ said the Duchess.”\\r\\n\\r\\nStrangely enough, this tale of mine opens in much the same fashion.\\r\\nOnly the lady who gave utterance to the exclamation was not a Duchess!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a day in early June. I had been transacting some business in\\r\\nParis and was returning by the morning service to London where I was\\r\\nstill sharing rooms with my old friend, the Belgian ex-detective,\\r\\nHercule Poirot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Calais express was singularly empty—in fact, my own compartment\\r\\nheld only one other traveller. I had made a somewhat hurried departure\\r\\nfrom the hotel and was busy assuring myself that I had duly collected\\r\\nall my traps when the train started. Up till then I had hardly noticed\\r\\nmy companion, but I was now violently recalled to the fact of her\\r\\nexistence. Jumping up from her seat, she let down the window and stuck\\r\\nher head out, withdrawing it a moment later with the brief and forcible\\r\\nejaculation “Hell!”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I am old-fashioned. A woman, I consider, should be womanly. I have\\r\\nno patience with the modern neurotic girl who jazzes from morning to\\r\\nnight, smokes like a chimney, and uses language which would make a\\r\\nBillingsgate fishwoman blush!\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked up now, frowning slightly, into a pretty, impudent face,\\r\\nsurmounted by a rakish little red hat. A thick cluster of black curls\\r\\nhid each ear. I judged that she was little more than seventeen, but her\\r\\nface was covered with powder, and her lips were quite impossibly\\r\\nscarlet.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing abashed, she returned my glance, and executed an expressive\\r\\ngrimace.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dear me, we’ve shocked the kind gentleman!” she observed to an\\r\\nimaginary audience. “I apologize for my language! Most unladylike, and\\r\\nall that, but Oh, Lord, there’s reason enough for it! Do you know I’ve\\r\\nlost my only sister?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Really?” I said politely. “How unfortunate.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He disapproves!” remarked the lady. “He disapproves utterly—of me, and\\r\\nmy sister—which last is unfair, because he hasn’t seen her!”\\r\\n\\r\\nI opened my mouth, but she forestalled me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Say no more! Nobody loves me! I shall go into the garden and eat\\r\\nworms! Boohoo! I am crushed!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe buried herself behind a large comic French paper. In a minute or\\r\\ntwo I saw her eyes stealthily peeping at me over the top. In spite of\\r\\nmyself I could not help smiling, and in a minute she had tossed the\\r\\npaper aside, and had burst into a merry peal of laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I knew you weren’t such a mutt as you looked,” she cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer laughter was so infectious that I could not help joining in, though\\r\\nI hardly cared for the word “mutt.” The girl was certainly all that I\\r\\nmost disliked, but that was no reason why I should make myself\\r\\nridiculous by my attitude. I prepared to unbend. After all, she was\\r\\ndecidedly pretty.\\u200a…\\r\\n\\r\\n“There! Now we’re friends!” declared the minx. “Say you’re sorry about\\r\\nmy sister—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am desolated!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s a good boy!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me finish. I was going to add that, although I am desolated, I can\\r\\nmanage to put up with her absence very well.” I made a little bow.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this most unaccountable of damsels frowned and shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Cut it out. I prefer the ‘dignified disapproval’ stunt. Oh, your face!\\r\\n‘Not one of us,’ it said. And you were right there—though, mind you,\\r\\nit’s pretty hard to tell nowadays. It’s not every one who can\\r\\ndistinguish between a demi and a duchess. There now, I believe I’ve\\r\\nshocked you again! You’ve been dug out of the backwoods, you have. Not\\r\\nthat I mind that. We could do with a few more of your sort. I just hate\\r\\na fellow who gets fresh. It makes me mad.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head vigorously.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you like when you’re mad?” I inquired with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A regular little devil! Don’t care what I say, or what I do, either! I\\r\\nnearly did a chap in once. Yes, really. He’d have deserved it too.\\r\\nItalian blood I’ve got. I shall get into trouble one of these days.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well,” I begged, “don’t get mad with me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shan’t. I like you—did the first moment I set eyes on you. But you\\r\\nlooked so disapproving that I never thought we should make friends.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, we have. Tell me something about yourself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m an actress. No—not the kind you’re thinking of, lunching at the\\r\\nSavoy covered with jewellery, and with their photograph in every paper\\r\\nsaying how much they love Madame So and So’s face cream. I’ve been on\\r\\nthe boards since I was a kid of six—tumbling.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I beg your pardon,” I said puzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Haven’t you seen child acrobats?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I understand.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m American born, but I’ve spent most of my life in England. We got a\\r\\nnew show now—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My sister and I. Sort of song and dance, and a bit of patter, and a\\r\\ndash of the old business thrown in. It’s quite a new idea, and it hits\\r\\nthem every time. There’s to be money in it—”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy new acquaintance leaned forward, and discoursed volubly, a great\\r\\nmany of her terms being quite unintelligible to me. Yet I found myself\\r\\nevincing an increasing interest in her. She seemed such a curious\\r\\nmixture of child and woman. Though perfectly worldly-wise, and able, as\\r\\nshe expressed it, to take care of herself, there was yet something\\r\\ncuriously ingenuous in her single-minded attitude towards life, and her\\r\\nwhole-hearted determination to “make good.” This glimpse of a world\\r\\nunknown to me was not without its charm, and I enjoyed seeing her vivid\\r\\nlittle face light up as she talked.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe passed through Amiens. The name awakened many memories. My companion\\r\\nseemed to have an intuitive knowledge of what was in my mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thinking of the War?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You were through it, I suppose?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pretty well. I was wounded once, and after the Somme they invalided me\\r\\nout altogether. I had a half fledged Army job for a bit. I’m a sort of\\r\\nprivate secretary now to an M. P.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My! That’s brainy!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, it isn’t. There’s really awfully little to do. Usually a couple of\\r\\nhours every day sees me through. It’s dull work too. In fact, I don’t\\r\\nknow what I should do if I hadn’t got something to fall back upon.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t say you collect bugs!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No. I share rooms with a very interesting man. He’s a Belgian—an\\r\\nex-detective. He’s set up as a private detective in London, and he’s\\r\\ndoing extraordinarily well. He’s really a very marvellous little man.\\r\\nTime and again he has proved to be right where the official police have\\r\\nfailed.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy companion listened with widening eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Isn’t that interesting, now? I just adore crime. I go to all the\\r\\nmysteries on the movies. And when there’s a murder on I just devour the\\r\\npapers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you remember the Styles Case?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me see, was that the old lady who was poisoned? Somewhere down in\\r\\nEssex?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was Poirot’s first big case. Undoubtedly, but for him, the\\r\\nmurderer would have escaped scot-free. It was a most wonderful bit of\\r\\ndetective work.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWarming to my subject, I ran over the heads of the affair, working up\\r\\nto the triumphant and unexpected dénouement. The girl listened\\r\\nspellbound. In fact, we were so absorbed that the train drew into\\r\\nCalais station before we realized it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My goodness gracious me!” cried my companion. “Where’s my\\r\\npowder-puff?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe proceeded to bedaub her face liberally, and then applied a stick of\\r\\nlip salve to her lips, observing the effect in a small pocket glass,\\r\\nand betraying not the faintest sign of self-consciousness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I say,” I hesitated. “I dare say it’s cheek on my part, but why do all\\r\\nthat sort of thing?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl paused in her operations, and stared at me with undisguised\\r\\nsurprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It isn’t as though you weren’t so pretty that you can afford to do\\r\\nwithout it,” I said stammeringly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear boy! I’ve got to do it. All the girls do. Think I want to look\\r\\nlike a little frump up from the country?” She took one last look in the\\r\\nmirror, smiled approval, and put it and her vanity-box away in her bag.\\r\\n“That’s better. Keeping up appearances is a bit of a fag, I grant, but\\r\\nif a girl respects herself it’s up to her not to let herself get\\r\\nslack.”\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this essentially moral sentiment, I had no reply. A point of view\\r\\nmakes a great difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nI secured a couple of porters, and we alighted on the platform. My\\r\\ncompanion held out her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-bye, and I’ll mind my language better in future.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, but surely you’ll let me look after you on the boat?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mayn’t be on the boat. I’ve got to see whether that sister of mine got\\r\\naboard after all anywhere. But thanks all the same.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, but we’re going to meet again, surely? I—” I hesitated. “I want to\\r\\nmeet your sister.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe both laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s real nice of you. I’ll tell her what you say. But I don’t fancy\\r\\nwe’ll meet again. You’ve been very good to me on the journey,\\r\\nespecially after I cheeked you as I did. But what your face expressed\\r\\nfirst thing is quite true. I’m not your kind. And that brings\\r\\ntrouble—_I___ know that well enough.\\u200a…”\\r\\n\\r\\nHer face changed. For the moment all the light-hearted gaiety died out\\r\\nof it. It looked angry—revengeful.\\u200a…\\r\\n\\r\\n“So good-bye,” she finished, in a lighter tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Aren’t you even going to tell me your name?” I cried, as she turned\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked over her shoulder. A dimple appeared in each cheek. She was\\r\\nlike a lovely picture by Greuze.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Cinderella,” she said, and laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut little did I think when and how I should see Cinderella again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'\n",
